			<h2>we are not consumers</h2>
				<p>There&#8217;s a tendency, even among those who are trying to buy less stuff, to call everyone &#8220;consumers&#8221;. The company needs to please its consumers &#8230; we consumers need to vote with our dollars &#8230; we need watchdogs to protect consumers &#8230; consumers are buying less during the recession.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s stop that. We are not consumers.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re people.</p>

<p>When we allow ourselves to be branded with these types of corporate terms, we&#8217;ve given in to the consumerist mindset. We&#8217;ve allowed the debate to be framed around buying: should we buy organic or local? How can we protect consumers? Do consumers have rights? What&#8217;s the best way to spend our money on products? How can we be savvy consumers? How can we affect change in society by making ethical or conscious buying choices?</p>

<p>What about the question of whether we should be buying or not? That gets thrown out the window, because it&#8217;s already assumed in the term: we&#8217;re consumers. Of course we buy. It&#8217;s just a matter of how, how much, where, from whom, how often.</p>

<p>But if we stop thinking of ourselves as consumers, and start calling ourselves &#8220;people&#8221;, then we open up the question. Should we even buy in the first place? Is it possible to live a life without buying?</p>

<p>We talked a bit about that in <a href="#reimagined">society, reimagined</a> &#8230; that we can grow our own food, make and trade and share everything we need. It&#8217;s possible &#8212; of course it&#8217;s possible! Human beings (not consumers) did it for hundreds of thousands of years, and at least 10,000 years in civilized society: we lived and worked and played and loved, without buying. We did it in tribes, of course, but also in larger societies that weren&#8217;t based around the basic unit of corporation -&gt; consumer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not advocating a return to tribalism. I&#8217;m saying we need to change the debate. We need to stop calling ourselves consumers. We need to open up our minds, so that a different way is possible.</p>
