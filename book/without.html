			<h2>can you live without?</h2>
				<p>People often mistakenly think that to be a minimalist, you need to live with less than 100 things (or 50 or something crazy like that). That&#8217;s not at all true.</p>

<p>A minimalist is simply one who questions the necessity of things, and who tries to live with what&#8217;s necessary, rather than with consumerism.</p>

<p>The 100 thing challenge is just a tool: by trying to reduce your possession to 100 things, it forces you to look at them and ask, &#8216;Is this really necessary? Can I live without it?&#8217;</p>

<p>So forget about the 100 things challenge, and instead just as yourself the questions. Is it really necessary? Can you live without it?</p>

<p>For example, could you live without these things:</p>


<ul>
<li>Cable TV</li>
<li>A smart phone</li>
<li>Any kind of cell phone</li>
<li>Any kind of TV</li>
<li>An Internet connection</li>
<li>A couch</li>
<li>More than one pair of shoes</li>
<li>More than a few shirts, or pants</li>
<li>A microwave</li>
<li>A car</li>
<li>Sweets</li>
<li>More than a handful of books (at a time)</li>
<li>Makeup</li>
<li>Hair</li>
<li>Mementos</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of you will find a few of those items so necessary that it&#8217;s ridiculous to ask the question. And I&#8217;m not saying you should give any of these things up &#8230; I&#8217;m only suggesting you ask the questions.</p>
