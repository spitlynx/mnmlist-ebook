			<h2>minimalist eating</h2>
				<p>How does a minimalist eat? Just a few grains of rice each day, perhaps?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no one way, of course, but one thing to consider is whether eating huge amounts of food, super-sized fast food meals and mountains of fried cheesy food that you find at chain restaurants &#8230; whether this American style of eating is consistent with the minimalist philosophy.</p>

<p>I say no. A minimalist would more likely eat less, prepare food simply with few ingredients, eat mindfully, and eat sustainably.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how.</p>


<ul>
<li>Eat less. If you&#8217;re overweight, eating less is absolutely the best thing you can do. If you&#8217;re underweight, eating less isn&#8217;t a good idea. But the Okinawans, reknowned for their incredible health and longetivity, do so well in part because they eat fewer calories than most people. They stop when they&#8217;re 80% full. I&#8217;ve been doing this with great results. Trick is to cut back on your portions a little at a time, and your stomach slowly grows smaller. It&#8217;s not hard if you do it slowly, gradually. Don&#8217;t starve yourself, but learn to eat until you&#8217;re almost full &#8212; after 5 minutes, you&#8217;ll realize you really are full.</li>
<li>Fewer ingredients. Try three-ingredient recipes (other than spices, oil &amp; water) &#8212; there are lots of them on the web. I like oatmeal, nuts &amp; fruit (with cinnamon); black bean chili with tomatoes (and cilantro, cayenne, chiles, salt); black beans &amp; quinoa; soy yogurt, berries &amp; nuts; coconut flakes, fruit &amp; soymilk; apples &amp; almonds. You get the idea.</li>
<li>Simple preparation. The above dishes require very little preparation. If you really love cooking, this tip won&#8217;t be for you, but for those who normally eat out or eat packaged foods, it&#8217;s important to find foods that don&#8217;t require a lot of prep time. You want to do little work with few ingredients &#8212; just fresh, real food that is flavorful and healthy.</li>
<li>Eating mindfully. Instead of eating while you watch <span class="caps">TV, </span>try paying attention to each bite, savoring your food and getting the most out of it while eating less.</li>
<li>Eating sustainably. A plug for veganism, which is more sustainable than meat and dairy because plants require fewer resources (yes, even fewer than free-range animals). If everyone became vegan, we&#8217;d have more than enough food to feed the world, and we&#8217;d use fewer resources with less carbon emissions.</li>
</ul>
