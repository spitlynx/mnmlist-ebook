<p>One of the basics of minimalism is that you eliminate as many non-necessities as you can, to make room for what&#8217;s important.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t need a ton of clothing, you get rid of much of it. If you don&#8217;t need that new gadget, you don&#8217;t buy it. Within reason, of course.</p>

<p>You learn to be content with what you already have, with the necessities, with doing things you love rather than having things.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s funny, because often things we assume are necessities are not necessarily so. The problem is that we categorize things as necessities because we&#8217;re used to them, and we can&#8217;t see how to live without them. And it&#8217;s difficult to make big changes.</p>

Some examples:<br />
<ul>
	<li><strong>A car</strong>. Cars are seen as necessities, but amazingly, people lived without them for quite awhile before the 20th century. Even today, <a href="http://carfreefamily.blogspot.com/">some people</a> manage to <a href="http://daily.sightline.org/daily_score/series/the-year-of-living-car-lessly-experiment">go carless</a>. And it&#8217;s not impossible &#8212; especially if you live in a place with a decent public transportation system. And there are car sharing options now in many cities, so you can use a car when you need it, for much less than actually owning a car. It&#8217;s possible to bike and walk most places, and take public transit and shared cars everywhere else.</li>
	<li><strong>Meat</strong>. Many people believe they can&#8217;t live without steaks and burgers. And I was one of them. These days, I&#8217;m not only vegetarian, but mostly vegan. And it&#8217;s not that hard to change, if you do it slowly. It&#8217;s also healthier and better for the environment &#8212; meat and dairy animals are tremendously harmful to the environment and a huge waste of our natural resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Lots of clothes</strong>. While I don&#8217;t advocate going naked (though some do it) nor do I recommend just owning one outfit, it is possible to own less clothing than most people have. We don&#8217;t need to constantly buy clothes to stay fashionable &#8212; we can buy quality, timeless clothing, with colors and patterns chosen so that all our clothes go with each other.</li>
	<li><strong>A big house</strong>. Have less stuff, you need less house.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few examples &#8212; think about all the things you consider necessities. Are they really? What&#8217;s really needed, beyond food, shelter, basic clothing, and loved ones?
