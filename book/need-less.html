			<h2>you need less than you think</h2>
				<p>It&#8217;s amazing what our culture has done to us: we have been conditioned to believe that luxuries are a necessity, that we need things that most of the world doesn&#8217;t even dream of having.</p>

<p>Look around your home right now (or when you get home). What do you see that&#8217;s really a necessity? What could you do without?</p>

<p>You already know that most of the world lives with much less than what you see around you. They&#8217;d be happy with clean water, shelter, some food. Forget about Macs or big-screen TVs or plush couches or iPhones or closets overflowing with shoes and clothes.</p>

<p>But we also forget that only a few generations ago, our grandparents and great-grandparents also lived with much less, and were perfectly comfortable and happy. Most people had very little other than the necessities and perhaps a radio. Not that long ago, people lived without TVs, cars, microwaves, electric stoves, computers, video game consoles, air-conditioning, washers, dish washers and more. Not that long ago, shopping malls didn&#8217;t exist, and ordering from the Sears catalog was a luxury.</p>

<p>What we need is very little: a few changes of clothing at most, a pair of shoes, perhaps a few toiletries (toothpaste, deodorant, soap), some food, a roof over our heads.</p>

<p>Consider:</p>


<ul>
<li>The television: if you got rid of this, not only would you free up hours of your time, you&#8217;d spend less (on cable or <span class="caps">DVD</span>s). You&#8217;d have room for reading, exercise, spending time with others.</li>
<li>All your clothes: could you wear just a few items? I do, and nobody seems to care.</li>
<li>Food: instead of eating out or buying convenience food, could you pick a dozen whole foods and make a weekly menu based on it? Think: beans &amp; rice &amp; veggies, or whole oats with nuts &amp; berries, or salads with nuts &amp; beans, or fruit &amp; nuts.</li>
<li>Furniture: what is the absolute minimum you could get by with, and still live a happy life? What are your core activities (sleeping, reading, eating?), and what do you need for each?</li>
<li>Gadgets: Once upon a time, you lived without them. What would life be like if you went back to that lifestyle? Would you have more distraction-free time?</li>
<li>The computer: <span class="caps">OK, </span>sure, this seems to be a necessity these days. But is it? Sometimes I wonder if I could get by with 1-2 hours of computer time a day at my local library. I really think I could, but I haven&#8217;t taken that brave leap yet.</li>
<li>The car: Many people live happily without it. It is a resource hog, uses tons of your money (and the work that goes to earn that money), contributes to global warming, is dangerous. Could you give it up someday?</li>
<li>The washer/dryer: Could you hand-wash your clothes each day? It takes about 10-15 minutes.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are other things in your home, I&#8217;m sure, that you could reconsider. Let&#8217;s keep our minds open.</p>
