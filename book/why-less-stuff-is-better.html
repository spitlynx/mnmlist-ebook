<p>People sometimes look at me quizzically when I proclaim that I don&#8217;t need more stuff, and that I&#8217;m constantly getting rid of what I do have.</p>

<p>What kind of weirdo is this? Why would you want less stuff?</p>

<p>Less is better.</p>

<p>Less means you spend less. You need less storage. You need a smaller house.</p>

<p>Less means you worry less. You search for things less. You are less bogged down by clutter.</p>

<p>Less means you&#8217;re lighter. You&#8217;re freer. You can focus on better things.</p>

<p>Less means you can travel more quickly. You spend less time with stuff, and more time doing stuff.</p>

<p>Less is more sustainable, more beautiful.</p>
