			<h2>minimalism vs. fear</h2>
				<p>Fear stops us from being minimalists.</p>

<p>Why do we keep things even if we don&#8217;t need or use them? Because we&#8217;re afraid we might. Afraid of what could happen if we get rid of those things.</p>

<p>For years I had a car because I worried about emergencies and not being able to do the things I wanted or needed to do. Then I discovered that I could do everything I need and more without a car. And that 911 is better in real emergencies.</p>

<p>This winter in San Francisco it was shockingly cold for an island native like me. I bought much more stuff than I&#8217;ve had in awhile (almost all from thrift shops) because I don&#8217;t know how to live in cold weather. The uncertainty of what I don&#8217;t know caused me to allay those fears with more possessions.</p>

<p>First: as we get to know something better we become more confident that we don&#8217;t need as much as we once thought we did. As I learn about living in cold I begin to realize that a few smart items are all I need. As I learn about traveling I learn I need almost nothing. As I learn about blogging I learn I don&#8217;t need ads or stats trackers or comments or widgets or Facebook buttons.</p>

<p>Second: fear can be conquered through small tests. Try going without something for just a little while (a day or a week) and see what happens. You&#8217;ll find that fears are not as justified as we thought.</p>

<p>Third: sometimes being naked with fear is a good experience. It teaches us a lot about ourselves and about life. It is scary but it awakens us. Live with the fear and without the safety net and see what it&#8217;s like to be alive and uninsulated.</p>
