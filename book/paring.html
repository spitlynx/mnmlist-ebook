			<h2>paring down</h2>
				<p>One of the things I love about minimalism is that it doesn&#8217;t end. You don&#8217;t get to a minimum of things and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a constant paring down. And that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>

<p>Why would you want to keep doing it, instead of just completing the process? Because the process of paring down is really the process of asking yourself, &#8220;What&#8217;s important?&#8221;</p>

<p>We tend to forget what&#8217;s important in the din and tumult of daily life. We need a mindfulness bell to bring us back to the essentials, and paring down is that bell for me.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples of paring down &#8212; I whittle down my clothing collection, for example, on a regular basis. I will look at a room and remove unnecessary objects. I&#8217;ll clear out programs on my computer I don&#8217;t use.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://zenhabits.net">Zen Habits</a>, I pare down the design regularly. A couple years ago, the site was considered an example of <a href="http://thefuturebuzz.com/2008/07/30/25-examples-of-clean-effective-and-beautiful-web-design/">clean design</a>, but since then I&#8217;ve removed most elements.</p>

<p>Recently I removed numerous links in the sidebar and footer, and then removed photos. It was like breathing out a sigh of relief, to be able to let go of photos. No one seemed to mind &#8212; I didn&#8217;t get any comments. I love it when paring down is met with the approval of silence. As on mnmlist, I&#8217;m removing almost everything but the article, which is the only thing that&#8217;s important.</p>

<p>Paring down has been a beautiful way to hone in on the essentials, to be mindful each day of those essentials. I think that&#8217;s a necessary thing these days.</p>
