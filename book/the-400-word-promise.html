			<h2>the 400-word promise</h2>
				<p>After some consideration, and feedback from <a href="http://twitter.com/zen_habits">Twitter</a> friends, I&#8217;ve made a firm decision:</p>

<p>As of my <a href="#the-beauty-of-small">last post</a>, I will stick to a self-enforced, strictly-adhered-to limit of 400 words per post here on <strong>mnmlist</strong>.</p>

<p>Unless I need more room.</p>

<p>I think this is in keeping with the philosophy of this site: keep things minimal, stay brief, get to the point. When it makes sense.</p>
