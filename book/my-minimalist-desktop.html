<p>I love seeing other people&#8217;s desktops, so I thought I&#8217;d show mine as an example of a clean, minimalist desktop.</p>

<p>The desktop pic changes now and then &#8212; right now it&#8217;s a snow leopard, reminiscent of the new <span class="caps">OSX </span>snow leopard. I enjoy pics that are calm but inspiring.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve removed all icons, including hard drive icons (go to Preferences in the Finder, unselect hard disks from &#8220;show these items&#8221; list). I&#8217;ve also removed the menu bar using <a href="http://www.cynosurex.com/Software/MagicMenu/">MagicMenu</a>.</p>

<p>I autohide the Dock (go to Dock preferences, and &#8220;turn hiding on&#8221;), as I never use the dock for launching applications or documents &#8212; I use <a href="http://blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> instead. Quicksilver launches things faster than the Dock or even Spotlight, in my experience, and can do much more than launch (appending text, emailing items, cropping photos, and more).</p>

<p>For awhile, I was just using a blank desktop pic, with no icons, dock or menu bar, but the only thing I missed from the menu bar was the clock. So I added the time and date via <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool</a>, along with my favorite quote.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there&#8217;s nothing there. Which is how I like it.</p>
