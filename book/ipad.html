			<h2>why i won&#8217;t be buying an ipad</h2>
				<p>Because I don&#8217;t need one.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the future of computing, the most beautiful computer ever, the coolest thing since Pulp Fiction, the world&#8217;s best gaming platform, the vehicle for some of the most amazing apps ever (already there are drool-worthy ones available) and I don&#8217;t doubt I&#8217;ll get one eventually. My wife will probably get one.</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t need an iPad last month or last year, and I will venture to guess (I could be wrong) that I&#8217;ll be just as happy, fit and productive without the iPad.</p>

<p>The iMac and Macbook Air I bought two years ago are working brilliantly and fulfill my every computing need, and probably can for at least 2-3 more years. I&#8217;ve resisted buying an iPhone for several years because I don&#8217;t need one (despite their ultimate coolness), and the iPad is another way cool gadget I don&#8217;t need.</p>
