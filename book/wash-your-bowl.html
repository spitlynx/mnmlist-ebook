			<h2>wash your bowl</h2>
				<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nozen.com/washbowl.htm">a famous Zen story</a> that goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>A monk told Joshu, &#8220;I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me.&#8221;<br />
Joshu asked, &#8220;Have you eaten your rice porridge?<br />
The monk replied, &#8220;I have eaten.&#8221;<br />
Joshu said, &#8220;Then you had better wash your bowl.&#8221;<br />
At that moment the monk was enlightened.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to try to explain that story, as I am far from enlightened enough to understand it. Instead, I&#8217;d like to focus the wonderful simplicity of that advice:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have you eaten your rice porridge? Then you had better wash your bowl.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is something I think of every time I eat, and in fact whenever I&#8217;m done doing something. &#8220;Done eating? Then wash your bowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is something profound and yet minimalist about this advice. It&#8217;s: don&#8217;t get your head caught up in all this thinking about the meaning of life &#8230; instead, just do. Just wash your bowl. And in the washing, you&#8217;ll find all you need.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found this to be true. I literally wash my bowl after eating, slowly and with mindfulness. It&#8217;s satisfying, and takes no money and little resources.</p>

<p>When I take a shower, I hand wash my dirty clothes (if they&#8217;re dirty), wring them out, hang them to dry. When I change, I carefully put away the clothes I&#8217;ve changed out of. When I prepare food, I wipe the counter and put away the ingredients. At least I try to &#8211; I don&#8217;t claim to be perfect.</p>

<p>Remembering to do these things when we&#8217;re done with the activity isn&#8217;t just about neatness. It&#8217;s about mindfulness, about completing what we started, about being present in all we do instead of rushing to the next activity.</p>

<p>Wash your bowl, with care and joy.</p>
