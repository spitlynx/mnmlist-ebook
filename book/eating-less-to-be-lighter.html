			<h2>eating less to be lighter</h2>
				<p>While you might read a lot of posts about the minimalist aesthetic, as well as on owning less stuff, what isn&#8217;t talked about enough is minimalist eating.</p>

<p>As Americans, we eat way too much (and waste too much food as well). As someone who was at least 60 lbs. overweight only a few years ago, I packed away the food as much as anyone else. I know what it&#8217;s like to eat entire pizzas by myself, eat super-sized fast-food meals plus extra nuggets and desserts and more, finish the gigantic heaping plates of food that the restaurants serve these days.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too much, and it&#8217;s led to an obesity epidemic of alarming proportions. A large part of our healthcare crisis is because of our overeating.</p>

<p>A good part of the solution is to simply eat less.</p>

<p>A separate discussion should be about what we eat &#8212; organic, real foods, preferably grown locally, cooked at home with a minimum of processing and packaging. But today, I&#8217;d just like to talk about eating less.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve focused on in my own life, especially recently, as I look at not only quality of food but quantity. I think we&#8217;ve been conditioned to eat without thinking, and in doing so to eat way too much. To stuff ourselves until we&#8217;re gorged. Which of course isn&#8217;t healthy at all.</p>

<p>My focus has been on eating until I&#8217;m not quite full. I eat until I feel like I want a little more, and then pause. Breathe. In about 10 minutes, I realize I&#8217;m satisfied and don&#8217;t need to eat any more.</p>

<p>Some tips if you&#8217;d like to accomplish this:</p>


<ul>
<li>Only take a small portion to start with. Don&#8217;t heap the plate.</li>
<li>Eat slowly and mindfully.</li>
<li>Pause between bites. Savor the food.</li>
<li>Stop before you&#8217;re full, and wait.</li>
<li>Drink water with your food.</li>
<li>Eat every 2-3 hours, or embrace the hunger and wait a little longer.</li>
<li>If you get hungry again soon after, eat a small snack &#8212; a fruit, some veggies, a handful of nuts.</li>
<li>Cut back slowly. Don&#8217;t try to eat like a bird at first. Just eat a little less for now, adjust, and then cut back a little more.</li>
</ul>



<p>Over time, you&#8217;ll change, and be able to eat less. You&#8217;ll be healthier (assuming you were eating too much before) and lighter and living more sustainably.</p>
