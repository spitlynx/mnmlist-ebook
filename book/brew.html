			<h2>I am not a brewer</h2>
				<p>I&#8217;ve been learning a bit about beers lately (and enjoying the learning process) and on the top <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/lists/top">beer ratings</a> <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/">sites</a> a beer from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westvleteren_Brewery">Westvleteren Brewery</a> tops the rankings.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a Belgium beer brewed by monks who absolutely fascinate me. They brew the best beer in the world and yet seem to care nothing about business. As their beer has gained fame they refuse to raise production to meet demand. They refuse to market their beers and have no label on their bottles. They do no advertising and don&#8217;t allow interviews or tours of their brewery &#8212; you can visit a visitors&#8217; center across the street but they don&#8217;t want to be bothered. You can only buy two cases at a time and you have to drive to their brewery to get it &#8212; and only after reserving via phone.</p>

<p>They are crazy dudes but I love them. They are not interested in making money or fame or accomplishments. They just want to be monks.</p>

<p>Father Abbott said on the occasion of the consecration of their new brewery &#8220;But we do not live &#8216;for&#8217; our brewery. This must be strange for business people and difficult to understand that we do not exploit our commercial assets as much as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on to say &#8220;We are no brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m with him.</p>

<p>I am not a blogger. I am no author. I am a simple man who enjoys a simple life with his family. I write to be able to afford living that simple life.</p>
