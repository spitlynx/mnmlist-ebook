			<h2>Be able to walk away</h2>
				<p>In any kind of negotiation, your ability to walk away is your strongest tool.</p>

<p>Those who can walk away from the negotiation &#8212; legitimately walk away, not just make a show of it &#8212; are in the strongest position. Those who are convinced they need to make the deal are in the weakest position.</p>

<p>This is true of negotiating when you&#8217;re buying a car, closing the sale of your new home, haggling in a foreign flea market, or trying to get a raise.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also true of anything in life.</p>

<p>Know that there&#8217;s almost nothing you can&#8217;t walk away from.</p>

<p>If you are convinced you need a nice house with a walk-in closet and hardwood floors and a huge kitchen, you now have a weakness. You will give away precious life hours and savings to get it. Someone else who knows that those things aren&#8217;t absolutely necessary can walk away, and not need to spend so much money (and thus work hours) on that kind of house.</p>

<p>If you are convinced that you need Stabucks grande lattes every day, or an iPhone or iPad, or an <span class="caps">SUV </span>or Cooper Mini or <span class="caps">BMW</span> &#8230; you are in the weak position, because you can&#8217;t give it up. Someone else might know that those aren&#8217;t essential to happiness, and can walk away.</p>

<p>If you know that there&#8217;s almost nothing you can&#8217;t walk away from, you can save yourself tons of money. Years of time. Mountains of headaches and heartaches. Boatloads of suffering.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to walk away from everything, but you should know that you can. And when the cost of the deal is too great, too dear &#8230; walk away.</p>
