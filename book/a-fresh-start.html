			<h2>a fresh start</h2>
				<p>As you know, in the last few weeks my family and I cleared out our possessions, and <a href="#moving">moved to a new city</a>. We&#8217;re loving San Francisco, missing our loved ones on Guam terribly &#8230; but the most interesting thing to me has been the idea of starting afresh.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re in a new city, a blank slate for us, and we&#8217;re allowed to reimagine our lives. That&#8217;s a scary thing, because as humans we cling to the familiar, find comfort in routines and in what we&#8217;re used to. We can handle change, but usually in smaller bits. Drastic changes, at the scale of everything we know, are difficult to handle.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also a wonderful thing, because a fresh start means you have nothing tying you down, nothing stopping you from creating the life you want.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s painful, in that we left behind the people we love the most. It was like tearing off a limb, except that you can live without a limb &#8230; living without these loved ones isn&#8217;t so easy. I don&#8217;t recommend it to anyone else, but I also know that we will grow as people because of this experience, and become stronger for it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve gone car-free, which is something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a long time. It&#8217;s almost impossible to do on Guam, for many reasons, though we did manage to go car-lite while we were there. Today, we walk and take transit everywhere, and it&#8217;s easy. We plan to get bikes soon.</p>

<p>We purposely moved to a spot that&#8217;s near everything we need: groceries, a library, bookstores, restaurants, hardware store, bakeries, lovely parks, buses and trains. We could have lived cheaper or nicer if we were further away from everything, but we chose to be in a denser area, more walkable.</p>

<p>We are buying most of what we eat at farmer&#8217;s markets and in bulk bins, to reduce packaging and processed foods, both better for our health and the environment. We&#8217;re still working on this, but already it&#8217;s been a dramatic improvement.</p>

<p>We run in parks, sprint up hills, walk everywhere, eat fairly healthy, do bodyweight exercises whenever and wherever we feel like it, play in grass fields. We&#8217;re getting healthier and fitter than ever before, and we love it.</p>

<p>We have very little. And that&#8217;s perfect.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a fresh start. We&#8217;ve only begun to imagine the possibilities. It&#8217;s not home yet, but we&#8217;re going to make it the home we create.</p>
