			<h2><a name="essentials">10 essentials</a></h2>
				<p>I was reading a series in GQ called <a href="http://www.gq.com/about/ten-essentials">10 Essentials</a> where a designer or stylish celebrity names 10 things that are essential to them. I love the idea, but the lists seem like such tributes to luxury consumerism.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m the last guy that GQ would interview for this series (I have no sense of style, to start with), but it got me to thinking: what are my &#8220;10 essentials&#8221;?</p>

<p>And so I made a list:</p>

<p>1. <strong>What I wear</strong>: jeans. I love the thick texture of jeans. I wear them every day. Some people like synthetic fabrics because they&#8217;re lightweight and dry fast, but jeans are just comfortable. I only buy my jeans at Goodwill.</p>

<p>2. <strong>What I also wear</strong>: T-shirt. I only have a few &#8212; black, blue, and grey &#8212; but I wear them everyday until they get thin.</p>

<p>3. <strong>How I hydrate</strong>: water. I do drink coffee and tea, but neither compares to plain water. I drink from the tap, throughout the day.</p>

<p>4. <strong>What I love to eat</strong>: fruit. Fresh from the farmer&#8217;s market, or berries picked straight from the bush. Mmmm.</p>

<p>5. <strong>What entertains me</strong>: books. Any type. I get them used, from friends or the library.</p>

<p>6.<strong> My essential writing tool</strong>: a <a href="#nv">text editor</a>. I&#8217;ll also take a pen and small notebook, especially if I&#8217;m out and about and feel like writing.</p>

<p>7. <strong>What I do for fun</strong>: walk. I like to go outside and just take in the city, or nature. I don&#8217;t even need shoes &#8212; barefoot walking is even more enjoyable. Even better: walk with someone I like.</p>

<p>8. <strong>Where I go for inspiration</strong>: nature. A nice park, a garden, a forest, the ocean, hills.</p>

<p>I ran out of things at this point &#8212; and the last couple aren&#8217;t exactly things. I really tried for 10 items but I can&#8217;t think of more. If I have the 8 items above, I&#8217;m very happy: jeans &amp; t-shirt, water &amp; fruit, a book and a notebook, a walk in nature.</p>

<p>I could live on just those items &#8212; of course I&#8217;d need other food for nourishment, but not much more. I don&#8217;t even need a computer &#8212; I could write in a notebook and use a computer at a library to post to my blog.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need consumerism to be very happy &#8212; in fact, I&#8217;d argue that life is better without it.</p>
