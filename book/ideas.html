			<h2>paring ideas</h2>
				<p>As minimalists, we often talk about paring down possessions, and sometimes paring down what we do. But what about what we think?</p>

<p>Is there any use in paring down thinking? I&#8217;ve found myself doing this over time, in many areas.</p>

<p>My ideas about exercise have been simplified over the years. I used to worry about the ideal mileage, percentage of increase in mileage, intervals, reps and sets, weights and progression, lifts, workouts, programs &#8230; it was very complicated. But as I&#8217;ve learned more about fitness, I&#8217;ve dropped most of those ideas. I now know that none of that matters much, as I&#8217;ve let go of specific fitness goals. Now I just try to move on most days, and have fun doing it. I&#8217;ve dropped ideas about schedules, about programs, about loads and goals. I&#8217;m left with the simplest of ideas.</p>

<p>Same applies to diet. I used to worry about not eating grains, or soy, or processed foods, or fruits, or chemicals. Should I eat quinoa or steel-cut oats or amaranth or chia seeds or bulgur wheat or buckwheat? I used to count calories. Now I just try to eat real plant foods most of the time, and am mindful of my eating. It&#8217;s simpler this way.</p>

<p>About writing: I worried about structure and voice and style and terseness and grammar and schedules and tools and reading the best authors and the snowflake method and editing and much more. Now I just write when I&#8217;m inspired, and I let it flow.</p>

<p>About work: I worried about productivity and goals and action items and meetings and paperwork and the Pareto principle and the perfect desk and the perfect computer setup. Now I use simple tools, and do what I&#8217;m excited about.</p>

<p>The same is true of anything I&#8217;ve done. About finances, I just spend less than I earn, and have my bills paid automatically. About my site, I just write and publish and forget about comments and ads and stats and social networking. About my social life, I just meet with a friend and try to be present. I could go on all day, but you get the point.</p>

<p>When we start out with something, we usually will try everything. But as we learn, we can pare down ideas that we find out don&#8217;t matter. We&#8217;re left with the essentials.</p>
