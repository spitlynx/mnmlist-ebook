<h2><a name="facebook">why i deleted 1,000 Facebook friends</a></h2>
<p>Today I deleted 1,031 friends from Facebook. It was liberating.</p>

<p>As I <a href="#unfriending">talked about</a> before, having a ton of friends on social networks is a major pull on your attention, and results in superficial relationships anyway. I prefer deeper relationships when possible.</p>

<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t worked well for me as a social network in the past. I loved connecting with close friends and family, and old friends from high school. But as I added friends without any criteria, it became too much &#8212; a stream of people leaving updates, sending me &#8220;gifts&#8221;, inviting me to all kinds of things, leaving things for me on my &#8220;wall&#8221;. I couldn&#8217;t stand it, and rarely checked Facebook. Twitter became my social space.<br />
In the last month or two I&#8217;ve slowly been unfriending people on Facebook, a dozen or so at a time. It was a tedious process, so I did it in small chunks. But with more than 1,500 friends (at the peak), it would take all year to unfriend everyone.</p>

<p>So today, with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/TobiiRheaStarr">a reader</a> on Twitter, I found a faster method: go to Account, then &#8220;Edit friends&#8221; and click the &#8220;X&#8221; next to people&#8217;s names. There was still an annoying popup confirmation dialog box, but with my mouse hovering over the &#8220;X&#8221;, and a finger on the Enter key, I could do it quickly.</p>

<p>It took me 36 minutes to delete more than 1,000 friends. My criteria: I only left actual, real-life friends and family, plus old friends from high school. I got down to 99.</p>

<p>Yes, I could have just deleted my account and started from scratch. But it would have taken me much more than 36 minutes to re-friend the 99 close friends, family &amp; old high school friends again.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a reader or someone I know online, you didn&#8217;t make the cut. That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t love you. It just means I had to find a more manageable way. I prefer communicating with you on Twitter, so feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/zen_habits">@zen_habits</a> me there if you want to send me a message. I prefer public messages over private DMs &#8212; it&#8217;s transparent and makes the most of the responses I type.</p>

<p>I really do love my readers. It&#8217;s just that Facebook wasn&#8217;t the way for me to connect with you.</p>
