			<h2>minimalist backup</h2>
				<p>Recently some respected bloggers &amp; geeks have written about backing up your computer files &#8230; calling for the need to buy extra hard drives by the half dozen (<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/03/15/yes-another-backup-lecture">example</a>), regularly schedule backups and off-site transfers and much more.</p>

<p>This is the old-school computer expert lecture, and if you enjoy doing those kinds of things, that&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>I actually don&#8217;t, and so I don&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>What do I do instead? Here&#8217;s a simpler method:</p>


<ul>
<li>store files online (Google Docs or <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> for documents, Picasa or Flickr for photos, code in <a href="http://github.com/">github</a>, etc.)</li>
<li>keep working files in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (including my <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> file, <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> notes, drafts, and more)</li>
</ul>



<p>Using this method, I&#8217;ve never lost an important file.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an off-chance I might lose a scrap of information, because I&#8217;m not as anal about backing up as others. However, I&#8217;ve also realized that my data isn&#8217;t as important as I once thought, and letting others worry about backing up my files (Google, Zoho, Yahoo, Dropbox, et al) means letting go of control and letting go of those worries.</p>

<p>Will I lose something someday? Sure, maybe. But will it be the end of the world? No. If it takes 20 minutes to recreate something, that&#8217;ll be less than the hours I would have spent cumulatively backing things up or buying hard drives and <span class="caps">USB </span>thumb drives and off-line storage. If I lose a dozen photos of thousands I&#8217;ve taken, it&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve let go of the need to obsess about every bit of data, and with it I&#8217;ve dropped the need to obsess about backups.</p>
