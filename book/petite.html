			<h2>petite-productivity</h2>
				<p>There exists in France a small company called <a href="http://www.teddyfish.fr/aboutUs_us_english.php?page=US_PAGE">Teddyfish</a> that makes bags by hand.</p>

<p>Their philosophy of production is beautiful:</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe in &#8216;petite-production&#8217;, which means the willingness to work on slower rhythm and scale. Through creating and hand-making by ourselves, we are aiming to flavor our products with the warmth of the craftsmen&#8217;s hands, instead of the gasoline from the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Imagine if our world of mass-production was turned into a world of petite-production. People would hand-make clothing bicycles furniture food.</p>

<p>We would produce less and consume less. Things would cost more but people would make more for their labor.</p>

<p>We would love our work more. Produce quality things that last. Love our lives more. Call it Anti-Walmartization.</p>

<p>Slow down make less do it better be happier.</p>
