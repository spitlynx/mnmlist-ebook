			<h2>the beauty of a digital vacation</h2>
				<p>Yesterday I took a 24-hour digital vacation, ostensibly to protect myself from people spoiling the last episode of Lost for me, but really to just take a break.</p>

<p>It was lovely.</p>

<p>A break from digital communication, which I try to do now and then, is refreshing. It clears your life of the noise, and allows you to find quiet, to focus on the important, to be at peace.</p>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t do on my digital break:</p>


<ul>
<li>Check email.</li>
<li>Check Twitter or tweet.</li>
<li>Check or update Facebook, which I use just for keeping up with family.</li>
<li>Read my <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds.</li>
<li>Check any news sites.</li>
<li>Watch any TV except for the last Lost episode.</li>
<li>Watch any YouTube or other online videos.</li>
<li>Listen to any radio.</li>
<li>Read any Internet except for a few longer articles I already had open in my browser. These were <span class="caps">OK, </span>because they were just reading, nothing updated or connected.</li>
</ul>




<p>Some of the things I did do while on my break:</p>


<ul>
<li>Went for a run with my wife Eva.</li>
<li>Did a short zazen session with Eva.</li>
<li>Had really nice, long conversations with Eva.</li>
<li>Wrote a couple of blog posts.</li>
<li>Spent some time playing with my kids.</li>
<li>Watched the historic finale of Lost.</li>
<li>Had coffee.</li>
<li>Read some of the novel I&#8217;m reading, John Updike&#8217;s <em>Rabbit, Run</em>.</li>
<li>Caught up with the aforementioned long articles I&#8217;d wanted to read.</li>
<li>Shaved my head and beard.</li>
<li>Had a short visit from my dad.</li>
<li>Had a long, excellent visit with my grandma.</li>
<li>Had dinner with my mom and sisters, their kids, and Eva and the kids.</li>
</ul>



<p>Looking over what I didn&#8217;t do, and what I did do, I&#8217;d say the day was a success. I did things that gave me joy, and cut out things that just take up my time.</p>

<p>Am I saying we should all cut out these things &#8212; email, Twitter, Facebook, reading blogs, reading news? No, I think in smaller doses, they enrich our lives. We just need digital breaks on a regular basis, so they don&#8217;t take over our lives.</p>

<p>I plan to take a digital break once a week. Give it a try, and let me know what you think!</p>
