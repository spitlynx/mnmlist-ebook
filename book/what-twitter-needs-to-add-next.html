			<h2>what twitter needs to add next</h2>
				<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Twitter started with a brilliant idea of simplicity:</p>


<ul>
<li>Keep tweets to 140 characters or less, forcing people to be brief and to the point (unlike emails or blog posts).</li>
<li>Have one stream to read, as opposed to multiple things to check on.</li>
<li>Make it simple and easy to tweet or reply, from anywhere.</li>
</ul>



<p>And people loved the simplicity, and 3rd-party developers used it well to make great apps. Twitter&#8217;s simplicity is one reason it&#8217;s a better user experience than Facebook or MySpace.</p>

<p>Now Twitter has added lists and the new Retweet feature, and it seems they might be looking to add more. Others are calling for them to remove the 140-character limit, allow more customizations to profile pages, and add a whole host of other features.</p>

<p>No. Please, Twitter, don&#8217;t give in to the feature requests, the tendency towards feature bloat. I will live with the lists and retweets, but please stop adding new features.</p>

<p>Instead, focus on making what you have better. Improve your infrastructure so you don&#8217;t have the Fail whale ever appear. Make your search better. Get rid of spam. Make it easier to unfollow people. Make the site even simpler.</p>

<p>Even better, move towards an open protocol &#8212; allow interconnectivity with Identi.ca and other services so we aren&#8217;t trapped into one service. People don&#8217;t like being trapped.</p>

<p>Keep it simple, Twitter.</p>
