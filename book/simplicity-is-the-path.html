			<h2>simplicity is the path</h2>
				<blockquote><p>&#8216;There is no path to peace. Peace is the path.&#8217; ~ <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong>, &#8220;Non-Violence in Peace and War&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Simplicity, many people think,<br />
is an end in itself<br />
But they&#8217;re getting it backwards<br />
Simplicity is the path, the means<br />
It&#8217;s not a far off destination,<br />
somewhere in the future<br />
It&#8217;s right here, right now<br />
It&#8217;s taking things one at a time<br />
It&#8217;s asking simple questions<br />
It&#8217;s taking simple actions<br />
It&#8217;s doing it slowly<br />
It&#8217;s considering and being conscious,<br />
with everything</p>

<p>When you find yourself becoming overwhelmed<br />
on the path to simplicity<br />
Taking a complicated, frenzied path<br />
to get there<br />
Stop, consider, and choose<br />
the simpler path<br />
And take it slowly<br />
And easily<br />
And lovely</p>
