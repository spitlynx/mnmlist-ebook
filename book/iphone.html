			<h2>You don&#8217;t need the new iPhone</h2>
				<blockquote>&#8216;Men have become tools of their tools.&#8217; <strong>~Henry David Thoreau</strong></blockquote>

<p>Many of you have seen the video and reviews of the new iPhone 4S, and yes, it looks great.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t rush out to order it. Here&#8217;s why: you don&#8217;t need it.</p>

<p>True, it is sleek and sexy and full of great features like a great camera and personal assistant and a better screen, etc. But you don&#8217;t need it today any more than you needed it yesterday, or 5 years ago.</p>

<p>Yesterday, without the new iPhone, your life was good. Some of you were happy and content and were actually able to do your work and get on with your life without the new iPhone.</p>

<p>Today, Apple announces its newest device, and the press and tech bloggers swoon. We all have to get the latest device, or we&#8217;ll no longer be hip, we&#8217;ll no longer be part of the &#8220;in&#8221; crowd.</p>

<p>And yet, is it really that essential? I&#8217;ve wanted an iPhone for almost 5 years now, but haven&#8217;t bought one because I know I don&#8217;t need it. Will it make my life a bit more fun? Sure, possibly &#8212; but so will a walk in the park with my kids, or a hike with a friend, or a free book at the library. I don&#8217;t need to spend $199 plus thousands of dollars on a 2-year contract to make my life a bit more fun.</p>

<p>Five years ago, the iPhone didn&#8217;t exist. It wasn&#8217;t a need in your life. You were able to live perfectly without it. And now that it does exist, all of that is true.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s marketing that has worked on us, and we&#8217;re fools for it.</p>

<p>The same, of course, is true of all other technology and sleek consumerist products. It&#8217;s just that Apple is better at it than most.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t give in. Fight the marketing, by noticing and letting go of the urges that marketing creates in us. Find contentment without products. You&#8217;re better than that.</p>
