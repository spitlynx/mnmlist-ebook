			<h2>the minimalism of tea</h2>
				<p>Tea is a an act complete in its simplicity.</p>

<p>When I drink tea, there is only me, and the tea.</p>

<p>The rest of the world dissolves.</p>

<p>There are no worries about the future.</p>

<p>No dwelling on past mistakes.</p>

<p>Tea is simple: <a href="http://shop.samovarlife.com/">loose-leaf tea</a>, hot pure water, a cup.</p>

<p>I inhale the scent, tinydelicate pieces of the tea floating above the cup.</p>

<p>I drink the tea, the essence of the leaves becoming a part of me.</p>

<p>I am informed by the tea, changed.</p>

<p>This is the act of life, in one puremoment, and in this act the truth of the world suddenly becomes revealed: all the complexity, pain, drama of life is a pretense, invented in our minds for no good purpose.</p>

<p>There is only the tea, and me, converging.</p>
