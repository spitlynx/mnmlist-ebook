			<h2>downsides of minimalism</h2>
				<p>It&#8217;s true that I might too often make minimalism seem like it&#8217;s all roses, all upside. But there is a downside to everything, including minimalism.</p>

<p>In order to better prepare you, my lovely and good-hearted reader, for minimalism, it&#8217;s my duty to point out some of the downsides. Consider this post my due diligence.</p>

<p>Some downsides to minimalism:</p>


<ul>
<li>You get to know Craigslist, Goodwill and other charities all too well as you clean out your clutter.</li>
<li>You have to figure out other things to do with yourself besides shopping and browsing shopping sites.</li>
<li>If you travel lightly for a few weeks with only a small carry-on, customs officers might get suspicious &#8212; who travels with almost nothing, besides maybe a terrorist? My friends <a href="http://www.corbettbarr.com/">Corbett Barr</a> and his wife Jessie recently had this experience going into Europe with a small bag each &#8212; officials didn&#8217;t believe they were really traveling for three weeks without luggage.</li>
<li>People will tease you about which of your two shirts you&#8217;re wearing today. I don&#8217;t mind this &#8212; there are worse things to be teased about.</li>
<li>If you are a well known minimalist and happen to shop at the Gap or the Apple store, you worry that people will see you and judge you for hypocrisy.</li>
<li>If you give up your cable <span class="caps">TV, </span>you have to find other things to do. I like to read or exercise. Also, you aren&#8217;t aware of non-Internet pop culture &#8212; I had to Google Jwow recently (didn&#8217;t know who she was) and was shocked at how much I&#8217;ve apparently been missing.</li>
<li>Family will harass you about not buying gifts. They will live. So will you.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t get as good a workout walking around with a light bag instead of one laden with lots of stuff. I put weight plates in my backpack if I want to compensate for this.</li>
<li>People online will accuse you of being &#8220;trendy&#8221; because you&#8217;re a minimalist. People who aren&#8217;t online as much will wonder what the hell a minimalist is.</li>
<li>Your one pair of jeans will go from being dark and dressy to faded, frayed, and more welcome in an Occupy camp than in nice restaurants.</li>
<li>When family comes to visit, you&#8217;ll be confused as to why they have so much stuff with them, even if they&#8217;re just there to visit for a few hours.</li>
<li>When you go to other people&#8217;s houses, you might start mentally fantasizing about getting rid of their stuff for them.</li>
<li>People will ask you, almost non-stop, how you can be a minimalist with so many kids. If you don&#8217;t have any kids, they&#8217;ll roll your eyes and say, &#8220;Of course you&#8217;re a minimalist &#8212; you&#8217;re a bachelor!&#8221;</li>
<li>People will always, always try to point out the hypocrisy of being a minimalist and something else about you &#8212; your articles are too long to be a minimalist! You have 25 books &#8212; that&#8217;s not minimalist! Etc.</li>
<li>Others might feel threatened by you, because your minimalism will be seen as a criticism of their lifestyle. They will live.</li>
<li>You will get weird looks when you turn down free &#8220;schwag&#8221; at sporting events, conferences, parties. Who doesn&#8217;t want a bunch of free promotional junk?</li>
<li>People will give you pitying looks when they see you have a simple dumb phone, and can&#8217;t play Angry Birds or use Instagram on the train like they can.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a car, people will think you&#8217;re poor, even if you are wealthier for not having the car. And healthier, and time rich.</li>
</ul>
