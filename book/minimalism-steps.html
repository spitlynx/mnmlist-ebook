			<h2>minimalism in steps</h2>
				<p>You can become a minimalist overnight, by not only changing your mindset but renouncing all possessions.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not a realistic approach for most of us. We have families, jobs, lives, and unless we&#8217;re willing to give up those lives, our approach won&#8217;t be so drastic.</p>

<p>Slow change is best for most people.</p>

<p>And so I recommend you do it in steps, as I&#8217;ve done. Here&#8217;s what these steps might look like:</p>

<p>1. Stop buying unnecessary things. This step was important for me as I was trying to get out of a mountain of debt (achieved, btw). Only buy the necessities, and always ask yourself: is this truly necessary? Stop the bleeding first.</p>

<p>2. Get rid of the obvious things. Stuff that&#8217;s getting in your way, that you rarely ever use. You can often fill up a few boxes immediately, put them in your car, and donate them to a thrift shop or to friends and family the next day.</p>

<p>3. Get rid of more obvious things. Now that you&#8217;ve cleared up some of the clutter, you can take a look around and start seeing other things you rarely use. Box these up as well.</p>

<p>4. Clear the clutter on your floors. If your floors are barely visible because you have clothes and boxes and different items all over the place, start clearing your floors.</p>

<p>5. Clear other flat surfaces. Shelves, table tops, counter tops. They don&#8217;t have to be completely clear, but should only have a few essential objects.</p>

<p>6. Start going into closets and drawers. One place at a time, start clearing out clutter.</p>

<p>7. Cut back another third. At this point, you should have simplified drastically, but you can revisit what you still own and see things you don&#8217;t really use that often.</p>

<p>8. Start letting go, emotionally. For emotional reasons, there will be things that you &#8220;just can&#8217;t part&#8221; with &#8212; clothes or shoes or books or mementoes or gifts, childhood items. This is difficult, but given time, you&#8217;ll learn that such attachments aren&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<p>9. Get rid of another third. At this point, you&#8217;re pretty minimalist, but you can cut back more.</p>

<p>10. Et cetera. The process will never end, until you actually give up everything. I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>

<p>These steps are just a rough outline of what I went through, but it&#8217;s a look into a process that might help.</p>
