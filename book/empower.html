			<h2>empower people to create</h2>
				<p>We live in a world where we are passive consumers: we see an ad for an iPhone, new car, new clothes; we go to the store or website and buy the item; we use it, and then dispose of it when we&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>What if we could break free from that?</p>

<p>What if we could become creators, participants, sharers, empowerers?</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.urbanvelo.org/issue18/p58-59.html">awesome article</a> about three guys who not only build bamboo bicycles, but show people how to make them themselves, really highlights how this can be done.</p>

<p>These guys are transforming people from passive consumers to creators, builders, knowledgeable users. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>

<p>How can you empower people? How can you turn people from consumers into makers? How can you help people from being passive users to knowledgeable ones?</p>

<p>Change the world &#8212; it&#8217;s waiting for you.</p>
