			<h2><a name="distractions">clear distractions</a></h2>
				<p>When it comes to minimalism in <b>doing</b>, distractions are the biggest obstacle.</p>

<p>We must first identify what&#8217;s most important to us, what we&#8217;re passionate about, what we want to spend our time on. And then we must focus on those things first.</p>

<p>But the distractions. They get in the way of this focusing, no?</p>

<p>And so we must kill the distractions with the zeal of a maniacal dictator. Without all the actual bloodiness, you know.</p>

<p>Without distractions, you&#8217;ll be able to focus. You&#8217;ll find peace. You&#8217;ll find time for doing what you love.</p>

Here&#8217;s how:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Cut back your social networking to network (or two at the most) &#8211; including Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, forums, etc. These are hugely distracting.</li>
	<li>Cut back on your social networking &#8220;friends&#8221;. Stick to your actual friends and colleagues. Networking with thousands of people you don&#8217;t know is superficial and distracting.</li>
	<li>Limit time on social networking, email to specified periods. Set the times you allow yourself to do these activities &#8211; from 1-2 p.m., for example.</li>
	<li>Do less email. Start by sending less. Check email less often. Use the phone or face-to-face conversations when possible.</li>
	<li>Shut down the internet to work. Disconnect, and work without distractions.</li>
	<li>Separate consuming from creating. Reading and networking and emailing are different from actually creating. Do them at separate times.</li>
	<li>Set a limited reading time. If you read a lot on the web, or <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds, set limits and do it at specified times.</li>
	<li>Shut off notifications. Email, Blackberry, <span class="caps">IM, </span>whatever. Shut em down.</li>
	<li>Clear away icons on your desktop. File them all in one folder, and use an app launcher such as LaunchBar or Launchy.</li>

	<li>Use music to block out your surroundings.</li>
	<li>Get away from the computer, spend time with actual people.</li>
	<li>Shut off the smartphone. Seriously.</li>

	<li>Focus on the most important tasks first, before you get distracted.</li>
	<li>Set limits on your work hours. If your time is limited, you&#8217;ll find ways to make the most of that limited time.</li>
</ul>
