				<p>Kris Madden had a <a href="http://krismadden.squarespace.com/news/2009/12/2/leo-babauta-i-love-you-dude-but-your-last-post-sucked.html">thoughtful response</a> to my <a href="#slow-reading">last post</a> on reading slower, and I posted a response in the comments that I&#8217;d like to repost here:</p>

<p>Hi Kris &#8230; thanks for your thoughtful response! It actually gives me a chance to clear up some misconceptions.</p>

<p>Namely, you misunderstood a couple of points:</p>

<p>1. I didn&#8217;t mention reading comprehension in my post and if that was implied, I apologize. Slowing down was to make the process of reading &#8212; and of working in general &#8212; more enjoyable. That&#8217;s the main point of slowing down, not to comprehend more.</p>

<p>When we slow down, we move at a more leisurely pace, we don&#8217;t feel so rushed, we&#8217;re not trying to cram too many things into our day. And most importantly, we have time to think about what&#8217;s important, rather than just doing things as fast as we can.</p>

<p>2. I didn&#8217;t say everything had to be read at the same rate. I just said to read slower. This can be a different rate of slowness for different types of materials, but the basic point &#8212; to slow down to enjoy life more &#8212; remains the same.</p>

<p>3. Productivity as you&#8217;ve defined it is definitely the traditional sense. I&#8217;m rejecting that traditional definition, and have for awhile now. Read some of my posts on Zen Habits for more on this. I basically believe the traditional definition of productivity &#8212; to increase our rate of output &#8212; is outdated and based on an industrial model, where workers were machines and management tried to increase their productivity and thereby increase profits. I reject this &#8212; workers are not machines, but creative, imaginative humans with hopes and goals and the desire for freedom and happiness.</p>

<p>And so, I believe productivity shouldn&#8217;t be to output at a faster rate, but to lead to achieving things, to freedom, to happiness, to doing what you love. That&#8217;s why effectiveness is more important than rate &#8212; if you focus on what&#8217;s important, then you can get great things done, and do them in less time because you&#8217;re not trying to do too much.</p>

<p>Thanks for the opportunity to clarify my thoughts!</p>
