			<h2>as happy as possible</h2>
				<p>I believe I&#8217;m as happy as it is possible to be.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not crying out in ecstatic pleasure, or streaming tears of joy, but I am very happy. It&#8217;s not a peak of happiness, but a plateau of happiness that can go on for as long as I live.</p>

<p>This is a happiness I wish on everyone alive. The question then is, what are the factors that contribute to my happiness?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t have:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A huge house</li>
	<li>Massive wealth</li>
	<li>Fancy clothes</li>
	<li>A nice car</li>
	<li>A powerful job</li>
	<li>Cable TV</li>
</ol>
<p>And I don&#8217;t believe having any of those would contribute to greater happiness than I already have.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I do have that contribute to my happiness:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Time</li>
	<li>Loving relationships</li>
	<li>Meaningful work</li>
	<li>Health</li>
	<li>Books</li>
	<li>Enough</li>
</ol>
<p>The first six are seen as the goals of society by many people. The second six make me very happy, and I believe I have them because I decided to forgo the first six. I recommend this path.</p>
