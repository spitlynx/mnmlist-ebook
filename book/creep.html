			<h2>Featurecreep &#038; grandparents</h2>
				<p>There are things we think we need these days that are absolutely not needs. They are luxuries that, over time, we have grown to be accustomed to and rely upon.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s incredible how much people rely on these things, actually, and have come to think they&#8217;re necessary.</p>

<p>But they&#8217;re not. Consider your grandparents &#8212; did they have these luxuries? Did they survive without them? Were they fairly happy without them?</p>

<p>Only after we&#8217;ve grown used to these things do we think they&#8217;re necessary, but that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve bought into the marketing. These things are no longer luxuries &#8212; they&#8217;re required.</p>

<p>If our grandparents could live without them, and be happy, so can we.</p>

<p>Some things our grandparents lived without, that are really not necessary:</p>


<ul>
<li>microwave</li>
<li>dishwasher</li>
<li><span class="caps">SUV</span></li>
<li>Luxury car</li>
<li>food processor</li>
<li>smart phone</li>
<li>iPad or other tablet</li>
<li>flat-screen TV</li>
<li>refrigerators with ice makers (or perhaps refrigeration at all)</li>
<li>air conditioning</li>
<li>central heating</li>
<li>dryers</li>
<li>Roombas</li>
<li>hair dryers</li>
<li>workout machines</li>
<li>Kindle</li>
<li>toaster oven</li>
</ul>



<p>That&#8217;s just a start.</p>

<p>I would argue that the computer is the one exception. It is incredibly empowering. The rest are less necessary.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not arguing that you should never get any of these devices. I&#8217;m only offering a reminder that it&#8217;s not absolutely necessary, and most can be eliminated.</p>
