			<h2>&#8216;I could never give up&#8217;</h2>
				<p>I&#8217;ve found that when I talk about simplifying or minimalism in general, people are generally positive &#8230; but when you get down to specifics, they&#8217;re not always so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>When I talk about giving up unnecessary shopping or clothes or shoes, many people balk. When I talk about giving up a car, or getting a smaller home, or not drinking sugary coffee drinks, or giving up junk food &#8230; I always hear a lot of people who say, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to be a minimalist, but I could never give up my ____.&#8221; (You can fill in the blank.)</p>

<p>I thought the same thing, many times, when I&#8217;d hear about other people making changes. &#8220;I could never give that up,&#8221; I thought to myself.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my hamburgers or fried chicken, but now I&#8217;m a vegetarian.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my cable <span class="caps">TV, </span>but I&#8217;ve been without it for 6 or 7 years now.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my cigarettes, but I&#8217;ve been tobacco-free for nearly 5 years.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my sweets, and now I only have a few bites now and then.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my car, but I barely drive now and am going car-free next month.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up packaged foods, but now I almost only eat real food, unpackaged.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my coffee, but I recently have.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up my running shoes, but now I run barefoot.</p>

<p>I said I could never get down to a handful of clothes, but I have.</p>

<p>I said I could never give up TV altogether, but I am.</p>


<p>If you think you could never do something &#8230; stop saying it. You just might surprise yourself.</p>
