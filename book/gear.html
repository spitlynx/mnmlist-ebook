			<h2>avoid new gear</h2>
				<p>One of the more difficult issues I deal with as a minimalist is taking on new hobbies &#8212; they almost all require new gear.</p>

<p>If you want to start cycling, kayaking, yoga, climbing, adventure racing &#8230; one of the first things you do is look to buy the gear that&#8217;s required.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not immune to this. I&#8217;ve done it a thousand times.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned to be wary of this urge to buy new gear.</p>

<p>Thoreau once wrote, &#8220;Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suggested that if we want to try a new enterprise (or hobby), we do it in our old clothes first. This is good advice.</p>

<p>Want to run? Try it in the clothes you already have. Same thing with yoga, with cycling, with climbing. Try it in your old clothes.</p>

<p>You might need some gear: ropes, a helmet. Borrow or rent them at first. After awhile, if you&#8217;re sure you want to do the activity, see if someone is giving it away on Craigslist or Freecycle.</p>

<p>Wait until you&#8217;ve changed yourself before you change your clothes and gear.</p>

<p>When you inevitably try something else, don&#8217;t get new clothes or gear right away. And when you do find free gear for the new activity, give away your old stuff.</p>

<p>Also consider whether you really need to add a new activity to your life. Can you meet the same needs more simply? When I think about new hobbies, I realize that I can get everything I want by walking, running, playing in the park, going on hikes, reading library books, writing with the tools I already have, spending time simply with family and friends. These require no equipment, no new clothes.</p>
