			<h2>on wanting stuff</h2>
				<p>There are people who claim never to want stuff anymore, who just don&#8217;t care about cool clothes and gadgets and bags and notebooks, who have moved past desiring things.</p>

<p>Those people are lying.</p>

<p>Unless you&#8217;re a certified Zen Master, you never move beyond wanting stuff (and even the Zen Masters have their temptations, I&#8217;m sure). We&#8217;re humans, and we have desires. When the new iPhone comes out, I lust over it just as most technophiles like me do.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t, however, buy the iPhone. I&#8217;ve lusted after the iPhone since it first came out in 2007, and for more than four years, I&#8217;ve resisted getting one. Not because I like torturing myself, nor because I think I&#8217;m too cool for an iPhone, but because I don&#8217;t want to give in to the lust. I know I don&#8217;t need the iPhone, and I know my brain has been tricked into wanting it.</p>

<p>When we want things that are beautiful, cool, sexy (yes, we have semi-sexual desires for objects, and yes that&#8217;s weird) &#8230; we have been tricked. Not tricked because we&#8217;re ignorant, stupid, foolish, but because we&#8217;re human. Corporations have become good at tricking us, at tapping into our desires, and as a result we lust for and then buy their products.</p>

<p>Apple is one of the best at this, and it has done such a good job that when I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zen_habits/status/107189524114837504">tweeted a small observation</a> about Steve Jobs, I got Hate Tweets for my stupidity, blindness, retardedness, pretentiousness. All those words and more. Because I suggested that Apple&#8217;s marketing has worked very, very well on us (myself included).</p>

<p>Apple is not the only one, but it&#8217;s one of the best examples. We lust over other brands, including shoes, laptop bags, jeans, coffeemakers, hamburgers and more. The advertising has worked on us.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t be disappointed with yourself. There is no way to stop wanting, but there are ways to reduce the desires.</p>

<p>Stop going to malls and other places designed to get you to buy things.</p>

<p>Stop watching so much TV (or at least block all the ads) because it&#8217;s designed to get you to buy stuff.</p>

<p>Stop reading magazines full of ads designed to get you to buy stuff.</p>

<p>Stop reading catalogs, which are just ads.</p>

<p>Stop going to online sites that are full of stuff you might want to buy. Stop going to online shopping sites so much.</p>

<p>Stop looking at the things other people have, online and off, and learn to be happy with what you already have.</p>

<p>And when you do notice yourself wanting something (awareness is everything), pause. Pause some more. Put it on a 30-day list. Wait. The desires go away with time.</p>
