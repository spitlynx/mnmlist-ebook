				<p>Less can come in many forms. You can have fewer things, you can do fewer things, you can use fewer things, you can focus on fewer things.</p>

<p>But less isn&#8217;t just fewer: it can also be smaller.</p>

<p>Small is often downplayed in this world of &#8220;bigger means better&#8221;. But small is beautiful, and often better.</p>


<ul>
<li>Smaller banks aren&#8217;t &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;, requiring bailouts when they&#8217;re mismanaged, and yet they make very important community loans.</li>
<li>Smaller teams are more nimble, can adapt to changing environments faster, don&#8217;t require as much management or communication overhead, can work cheaply and from anywhere.</li>
<li>Smaller cars use less gas, are more maneuverable, cause fewer deaths, use fewer resources.</li>
<li>Smaller homes require less heating, less cleaning, less maintenance, force you to simplify, are cozier.</li>
<li>Smaller programs use fewer computer resources, take up less computer power and thus help the environment, work faster, get the job done with a minimum of fuss.</li>
<li>Smaller suitcases (such as a small backpack) are easier to carry around, fit easier in overhead compartments, don&#8217;t require you to check luggage and worry about luggage not getting to the right destination, are easier to pack and unpack.</li>
<li>Smaller websites (in terms of file sizes) are easier to load, faster, more responsive.</li>
<li>Smaller companies are also more responsive, less expensive, hungrier, more focused.</li>
<li>Smaller people are often faster, more nimble, humbler, take up fewer resources, and are very very beautiful (my <a href="http://twitter.com/ebabauta">wife</a> is an example).</li>
<li>Haikus pack a lot of punch into three tiny lines.</li>
<li>Smaller posts don&#8217;t take as much time to write or read, which is good for a lazy blogger. And a busy reader.</li>
</ul>



<p>Small is beautiful. Aim for smaller when it makes sense, and enjoy the wonder that ensues.</p>
