			<h2>minimalism isn&#8217;t just for the affluent</h2>
				<p>There&#8217;s a criticism of voluntary simplicity or minimalism (two flavors of the same thing) that seems to be widely accepted: that it&#8217;s a luxury of relatively affluent people, that it&#8217;s not something the poor can afford to do.</p>

<p>I disagree: anyone can do it.</p>

<p>Minimalism is simply eliminating the unnecessary. And while the poor (anyone who&#8217;s not in the middle class or above) might not have the ridiculously unnecessary things that the affluent have, there are usually things that can be eliminated.</p>

<p>The photos of minimalist houses, desks, and Macs that you see on many minimalist sites are obviously for the affluent &#8212; they have expensive furniture, computers, gadgets, homes that aren&#8217;t affordable for many people. But that&#8217;s not a requirement of minimalism.</p>

<p>In fact, there isn&#8217;t a requirement for minimalism. You can invent your own version, and if you&#8217;re more worried about how to survive until the next paycheck (I&#8217;ve been there), then cutting back on the unnecessary will help you get there. Look for unnecessary expenses (like eating out, going to the movies, buying junk food snacks, or renting <span class="caps">DVD</span>s) and eliminate them, finding ways to have fun that are free.</p>

<p>Eliminating unnecessary possessions also means you&#8217;ll need a smaller home, which will save on rent and heating/cooling. Buying fewer things means less debt. Spending time with loved ones or doing things you love means you spend less. All of these things are good whether you&#8217;re wealthy or not.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that the poor are often thought of as not having the luxury of even thinking about simplifying, or minimalism. They&#8217;re too worried about putting food on the table, or where the rent is coming from, or how to avoid creditors until the next paycheck. And there&#8217;s a lot of truth in that. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be true: anyone can pause, breathe, and decide to live differently.</p>

<p>Anyone can make the decision to do without the unnecessary, to cut off cable <span class="caps">TV, </span>to consider doing without a car, to only buy what&#8217;s absolutely necessary and to rethink what&#8217;s necessary. I&#8217;ve been deep in debt, and I know the feeling of drowning with no way to get out. I got out, mostly because I cut expenses to the bone while looking for ways to increase income. Minimalism helped me to get out of debt, and to get out of poverty. It&#8217;s not just for the affluent anymore.</p>
