			<h2>clutter is procrastination</h2>
				<p>When our houses or offices get piled with clutter, much of the reason is procrastination.</p>

<p>We all procrastinate &#8212; let&#8217;s just get that out in the open. There&#8217;s not a one of us who doesn&#8217;t, to some degree.</p>

<p>But while our tasks and projects can pile up, giving us some anxiety, the clutter is a visual sign of that procrastination, and carries with it just as much anxiety.</p>

<p>When we put down an object, a piece of paper, an article of clothing, a stack of mail &#8230; and we leave it there, undealt with, saying that we&#8217;ll put it away or deal with it later &#8230; that&#8217;s procrastination.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this piles up, accumulates over time, and then we&#8217;re stuck with a mountain of clutter that&#8217;s too overwhelming to deal with.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to deal with that mountain. I&#8217;ve shown you some methods. Get it down to minimal, and enjoy that.</p>

<p>But once you&#8217;ve dealt with the mountain, you need to stop it from happening again. That&#8217;s where beating your procrastination habits becomes so important.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re going to put something down, deal with it <strong>right now</strong>. It only takes a few seconds.</p>

<p>How long does it take to put dirty clothes in the hamper, or hang up a shirt that&#8217;s still clean? Like 15 seconds. How long does it take to sort through some mail, opening the envelopes right there, setting aside a few bills to be paid, filing a couple things, tossing the rest? Three minutes. How long does it take to put a book or magazine away? To put a piece of paper in the right file, or toss it? Seconds.</p>

<p>When you deal with things in tiny little bits like this, before they build up, it&#8217;s easy. Deal with them while they&#8217;re easy so you don&#8217;t have to deal with them when they&#8217;re hard.</p>
