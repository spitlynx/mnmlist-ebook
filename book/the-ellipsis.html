			<h2>the beauty of the ellipsis</h2>
				<p>On Twitter recently, I wrote: &#8216;The purest beauty in life is in the ellipsis.&#8217;</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/GaryJordon">Someone</a> then asked: &#8216;How is an omission the purest form of beauty?&#8217;</p>

<p>This is the essence of minimalism. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis">ellipsis</a> is the punctuation mark (&#8230;) that indicates an intentional omission. From Wikipedia: &#8220;An ellipsis can also be used to indicate a pause in speech, an unfinished thought, or, at the end of a sentence, a trailing off into silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>If that description doesn&#8217;t inspire thoughts of beauty in you, you might not be a minimalist.</p>

<p>A pause in speech is silence. Silence is one of the most profound ways to connect with your inner voice, with nature. Silence is the best part of speech.</p>

<p>An unfinished thought is any thought, really &#8212; if a thought is &#8220;finished&#8221; it&#8217;s dead. We are all of us in transition, all the time, and our thoughts can be no exception.</p>

<p>Trailing off into silence implies that there is much left unsaid &#8230; that what is said is only the start.</p>

<p>Intentional omission is the foundation of minimalism: we leave things out because they are unnecessary, and retain only what we need or use or love. Omitting the unnecessary is a thing of pure beauty.</p>

<p>Say less, and hear more.</p>

<p>Do less, and have a greater impact.</p>

<p>Make less noise, and appreciate the silence.</p>

<p>Send out fewer emails, and make each one count.</p>

<p>Tweet less, and each one becomes more meaningful.</p>

<p>Have fewer possessions, and enjoy the space.</p>

<p>Have fewer &#8220;friends&#8221;, but make each relationship stronger.</p>

<p>Appreciate the spaces between everything.</p>
