				<p>Taming a closet full of clutter can be a fearful thing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s overwhelming, and we imagine it being a feat of herculean proportions, taking weeks if not decades.</p>

<p>Our minds, however, are exaggerating just a bit. Decluttering a closet doesn&#8217;t have to be so intimidating or arduous a process.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it, simply. Please note: we are not going to teach you how to organize your closet. We&#8217;re going to teach you to empty it of all but the essentials. Read more: <a href="#minimalism-is-the-end-of-organizing">minimalism is the end of organizing</a>. So you won&#8217;t get a list of fancy closet organizers to buy. We&#8217;re selling and donating here, not buying.</p>

<p><strong>1. Set aside some time, and get some boxes</strong>. You might need a couple of hours. Or a few, if your closet is huge. Set aside an evening, if you have time in the evenings, or half a weekend day. Get boxes ready. You might need half a dozen or more, depending on how much junk you have.</p>

<p><strong>2. Take everything out, empty it into a pile</strong>. All of it. Alternatively, you could choose to do this one section at a time, which could be less overwhelming &#8212; but it&#8217;ll take a few extra steps, as you&#8217;ll have to repeat these steps for each section. Either way works.</p>

<p><strong>3. Quickly sort into 3 piles</strong>. Do not dilly dally, or sit on the fence. Here are the choices: keep, toss, or maybe. The maybe is only if you really really have a hard time deciding &#8212; you&#8217;ll put these in a box and store them for 6 months, getting rid of them after that time if you never needed them. The keep pile is for stuff you really love and actually use &#8212; if you haven&#8217;t used it for 6 months, put it in the toss pile. <span class="caps">OK,</span> 12 months for seasonal clothes (such as winter coats). If you have trouble getting rid of things for sentimental or other emotional reasons, see <a href="#how-to-let-go-of-possessions">how to let go of possessions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4. Clean, then put the keep pile back, organized</strong>. <span class="caps">OK, </span>everything sorted? Clean out the closet nicely. Put the keep pile back in the closet (unless the stuff belongs elsewhere). Put it back neatly, organized. This doesn&#8217;t have to take long. Leave spaces between things if you can.</p>

<p><strong>5. Deal immediately with the other piles</strong>. Take the maybe pile (I hope you kept this pile small) and put it into a box or two. Label it maybe, with today&#8217;s date. Store it somewhere out of sight, and don&#8217;t open it for 6 months. Toss the stuff in 6 months. Take the toss pile, and put it into boxes &#8212; stuff you&#8217;ll donate to charity, stuff you&#8217;re going to give to friends, maybe other stuff you&#8217;ll sell in a yard sale or on eBay. Throw the actual trash away, or recycle.</p>

<p><strong>Optional step 6</strong>: Breathe, and bask in the glory of your beautiful new minimalist closet. Enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, and just admire. So minimalist, so pure. So lovely!</p>

A few more tips:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Keep the floors as clear as possible. If you can keep them completely clear, even better. It&#8217;s much easier to clean this way, and looks much more uncluttered.</li>
	<li>Label storage containers. Clear containers are best, but labels are good (just tape w/ marker is good enough) so you can easily find stuff.</li>
	<li>Organize clothes by colors, if you&#8217;re anal like me. It looks more organized.</li>
	<li>If you still have too much stuff, edit some more. There&#8217;s always more stuff we can get rid of after the initial purge.</li>
</ul>
