<p>The rise of clutter has given birth to a whole industry: organizing.</p>

<p>We now have legions of professional organizers, whole companies that sell organizing products such as closet organizers, magazines and blogs on how to get yourself organized, and of course, the hand-held notebooks we call organizers &#8212; and their digital equivalent, <span class="caps">PDA</span>s and mobile devices.</p>

<p>And while I have nothing against professional organizers &#8212; they help people to find peace in lives of chaos &#8212; I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re necessary &#8230; if you adopt minimalism.</p>

<p>Organizing is only necessary when you have too many things to easily find what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<p>Think about it: when we organize a collection of books, it&#8217;s because when they&#8217;re not organized, we can&#8217;t find the books we want. But if we had, say, five books, we wouldn&#8217;t need to organize.</p>

The same applies to anything that needs to be organized:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Closets that have a minimal amount of things don&#8217;t need to be organized.</li>
	<li>Tasks only need a complicated system or productivity apps for organizing if you have a lot to do. Focus on only doing a few important things, and you barely even need a list.</li>
	<li>Finances only need organizing if they&#8217;re complicated. I&#8217;ll write about minimalist finances later.</li>
	<li>Files only need to be organized if you can&#8217;t let go of this need to organize them. With search so powerful these days, you can find things with a few keystrokes.</li>
</ul>
There are lots of other things that need to be organized, if they&#8217;re not kept as simple as possible. I&#8217;m sure you can think of a few yourself. Consider making them as minimalist as possible, and the organizing will fade away.
