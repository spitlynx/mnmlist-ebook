			<h2>minimalism is just the start</h2>
				<p>I received some criticism recently that my minimalist philosophy of downsizing our lives is too individualistic a solution. I think &#8220;hyper-individualistic&#8221; was the term. (Actually most of the criticism was based on an outdated photo I used a few years ago, but I&#8217;ll focus on the part that interests me.)</p>

<p>That gave me pause to think: is it a valid criticism? And I think, at some levels, it is &#8212; the minimalism I propose (along with many others) is something we might adopt on a person-to-person basis, and possibly won&#8217;t be adopted by everyone in society. And if it isn&#8217;t, has it made a difference?</p>

<p>Sure it has &#8212; to the individual people who have adopted minimalism. It can change your life, for the better, and that&#8217;s nothing to sneeze at. But will it change the world? Will it solve poverty and global warming? Obviously not, if it&#8217;s only adopted by a small number of people. For it to work, it would have to be widespread.</p>

<p>So yes, I hear that. But must we only pursue solutions that will be adopted by everyone all at once? If we believe a course of action is better for us as individual people and for society as a whole, but we doubt whether society as a whole will adopt it, should we shun that course of action?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe so. I think that if a way of living is right, you should live that way. If it makes your life better, then good. If it&#8217;s adopted by the world, even better. We can&#8217;t let the problem of getting widespread adoption stop us from starting.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what minimalism as practiced by individual people is, at its heart: just a start. Socrates said, &#8220;Let he that would move the world, first move himself.&#8221; Gandhi said, &#8220;Be the change you want to see in the world.&#8221; I say, let&#8217;s start with ourselves. If we cannot walk the path, how can we ask the world to walk it?</p>

<p>Once we have shown that a minimalist life is not only possible, but a good thing, it will become a shining example to others. We can move others with our very lives. As Gandhi also said, &#8220;My life is my message.&#8221; Let your life be your message to the world, your example for a better life, and let that be the start.</p>

<p>From such small beginnings, great things can be born.</p>
