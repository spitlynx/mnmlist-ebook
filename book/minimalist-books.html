			<h2>minimalist books</h2>
				<p>Yes, books. I know for many of us, getting rid of possessions is an attractive prospect &#8230; but not books! Books are sacred.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Well, maybe. I love books as much as anyone. I love them in a physical way, with certain pleasure-inducing parts of my brain being activated by the smell, feel, look of books, new and used. I love browsing through bookstores for hours, discovering new worlds at every turn. I love cuddling up with them in the morning, or right before bed, escaping from reality for a little while. I love talking about books, reading about them, surrounding myself with them.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m learning to let go of the need to possess them for any substantial length of time. This has been a slow process. At first, I&#8217;d cull my fairly large collection of books by taking 10 or 20 here and there, and donating them or selling them to used bookstores. Then I got more aggressive and got rid of a lot, limiting myself to one (long) bookshelf. (Admittedly, the bookshelf extended itself as I stacked books below the shelf and then double stacked books, but it was progress, for me.)</p>

<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve decided to go even further. I&#8217;m rounding up all the books I&#8217;ve been keeping &#8220;just in case&#8221; &#8212; in case I want to read them again, or refer to them, or if I decide to get back into triathlons or marathons or whatever I used to be obsessed with. I&#8217;m planning to have a reader give-away of many of these books soon.</p>

<p>My new rule is pretty minimalist: <strong>If I don&#8217;t plan on reading the book in the next 6 months, it&#8217;s out</strong>. And I&#8217;m going to be realistic about how much I&#8217;ll actually read &#8212; one every two weeks at most.</p>

<p>If we learn to let go of this need to hold onto books, here&#8217;s a better approach, a more minimalist and saner way to live with books:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Massively purge yourself of your books. It&#8217;ll be difficult at first, but trust me: it&#8217;s also massively liberating.</li>
	<li>Check books out from the library. My library isn&#8217;t great (here on Guam) but when I move to <span class="caps">S.F. </span>this summer, I plan to make the <span class="caps">S.F. </span>public library my biggest bookshelf ever.</li>
	<li>When you&#8217;re done with a book you own, let it go. Give it to a friend to enjoy. Donate it to charity. Sell it to a used bookstore so you can read another book.</li>
	<li>Start a book-sharing group with your friends. Swap books you really enjoyed. You&#8217;ll save money and shelf space.</li>
	<li>Only keep on your shelf the books you&#8217;re going to read in the next 6 months. No more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Of course, there&#8217;s always the option of getting an ebook reader such as the Kindle or Apple&#8217;s long-rumored tablet computer. Then you&#8217;ll only have one device with possibly thousands of books. It&#8217;s an option I&#8217;ll probably move towards soon, as I decide what ebook reader I want. Maybe by the end of this year.</p>
